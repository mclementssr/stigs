Ansible Playbooks for Linux STIGs


I would like to thank both Sam Doran and Daniel Shephard. I originally came across Sam Doran project in October 2016 and used it to create the ansible STIG playbooks for RHEL 6 and RHEL 7. Currently my project has inherited over a 100 RHEL 5 system not STIG'd so I went looking for a RHEL 5 STIG playbook again and came across Daniel Shepherd project which I'm currently using to create a RHEL 5 playbook.
